# Quantitative Methods for Infectious Disease Epidemiology

This repository contains my assignment code for **EMD 538: Quantitative Methods for Infectious Disease Epidemiology**, a graduate-level course focused on statistical and computational methods for analyzing infectious disease data.

The code includes practical implementations of core models and methods used in infectious disease epidemiology, with an emphasis on transmission dynamics, outbreak analysis, vaccine studies, and time series analysis. Topics covered include chain binomial transmission models, estimation of the basic reproduction number (R₀), household transmission analysis, Bayesian inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), hidden Markov models and data augmentation, vaccine efficacy and vaccine effect models, infectious disease time series models (e.g., ARIMA and TSIR), and network-based transmission models.
